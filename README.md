# Geocache-GameMap

A mapping software designed for geocache gaming, written in C++ with the EZGL Graphics library, GTK++ glade and OSM (OpenStreetMap) database API.

Geocaching is a treasure-hunting activity that involves searching for a "cache" using GPS coordinates. Our map is designed to serve as a medium between the user and their prize by adding navigation abillities, game support and much more.

**Technologies:** C++, EZGL Library, GTKWidgets, Glade, OSM Database, Netbeans, Git

**Note:** Code cannot be published as this was completed under the course ECE297 at the University of Toronto.

Created in collaboration with Kerem Topalismailoglu and Diana Virgovičová.

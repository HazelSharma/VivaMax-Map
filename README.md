# Viva Max Map

A mapping software designed to provide a usable, and responsive GIS tool that encourages healthy living, written in C++ with the EZGL Graphics library, GTK++ glade and OSM (OpenStreetMap) database API.

Our team has 3 goals:
(1) Adding simple and clear graphics to visualize environments
(2) Having additional features that makes it easier for the user to explore physical and social activity options in their area
(3) Providing information to the user within fast response times

**Technologies:** C++, EZGL Library, GTKWidgets, Glade, OSM Database, Netbeans, Git

**Note:** Code cannot be published as this was completed under the course ECE297 at the University of Toronto.

Created in collaboration with Jin Xiao and Sumaiya Syeda.
